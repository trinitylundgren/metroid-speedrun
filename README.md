# Text-based WR Any% Super Metroid Speedrun

Can you make the right decisions to complete this text-based adventure as efficiently as ```Behemoth78``` did in his [2019 WR run](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eIRE_j4Uds) of the SNES classic Super Metroid? This exercise in object-oriented design and C++ implementation was an original final project for Intro to CS II. It runs in your terminal. 

## Getting Started

Download files and build with ```make``` at the command line.

### Prerequisites

Linux, gcc 11+, GNU make.

### Run the game
```$ make```
```./FinalProject```

This will build and launch the game. From there, select your difficulty level, explore the map, and make your choices.
